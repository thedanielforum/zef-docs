### Pragmatic Functional Programming  
No monads, no gonads, no monoids. No meta-mathematical torture. Sure, these patterns are there under the hood, but the user does not need to be aware of them. The user facing API should be both as simple **and** easy as possible. It should also fully align with the underlying principles, i.e. the syntax should reflect the semantics.
