## Environment variables

### ZefHub connections

- `ZEFHUB_AUTH_KEY`: what key to use to authenticate with ZefHub. A string of
  `GUEST` indicates authentication as a guest user. See
  [connections](configuration-connections) for more information.
- `ZEFHUB_URL`: the URL to connect to, by default `wss://hub.zefhub.io`.

### Information messages

These variables match to [zwitch options](configuration-messages)

- `ZEFDB_QUIET`: changes the default `zwitch` output options to be
  `zefhub_communication_output(False)`, `extra_quiet(True)`,
  `graph_event_output(False)`.
- `ZEFDB_VERBOSE`: changes the default `zwitch` output options to be
  `zefhub_communication_output(True)`, `graph_event_output(True)` and
  `extra_quiet(False)`.
- `ZEFDB_DEVELOPER_ZEFHUB_JSON`: turns on the `zwitch` option `debug_zefhub_json_output`.
- `ZEFDB_DEVELOPER_OUTPUT`: turns on the `zwitch` options `debug_times`,
  `zefhub_communication_output`, `graph_event_output` and `developer_output`.
- `ZEFDB_DEVELOPER_EARLY_TOKENS`: records any `ET`/`RT`/`EN`/`KW` tokens created
  before the python module is fully loaded. This helps in identifying "core"
  tokens that are required for the loading of the module which are missing from
  the public set of ZefHub tokens.

### Local storage

- `ZEFDB_FILEGRAPH_PATH`: where to store filegraphs, the caches for the zef graphs
- `ZEFDB_MEMORY_STYLE`: set to
  - `ANONYMOUS`: for mmap-ed in-memory graphs without file backing.
  - `FILE_BACKED`: for mmap-ed in-memory graphs with cached file backing, see `ZEFDB_FILEGRAPH_PATH`.
  - blank: for automatic choice. This is currently, `ANONYMOUS` for local graphs and `FILE_BACKED` for graphs accessed from ZefHub.

### Core behavior

- `ZEFDB_OFFLINE_MODE`: runs the butler in offline mode. You can't sync graphs
  or otherwise communicate with ZefHub in this mode. Currently, it is not
  possible to persist graphs locally in this mode either. You can create
  `ET`/`RT`/`EN`/`KW` tokens in this mode, although they will be assigned
  temporary values and won't persist beyond your python session.
- `ZEFDB_TRANSFER_CHUNK_SIZE`: influences the transfer of large graphs.
  Currently a bandaid on the websocket protocol, will be removed in the future.

### Config

- `ZEFDB_CONFIG_PATH`: the location of the directory where the config file is
  stored. Defaults to `$HOME/.zef`. The config file itself is located at `ZEFDB_CONFIG_PATH/config.yaml`.

The following variables match to configuration options that can be modified through the
`config` zefop. The variables will be merely listed here, see [config](configuration-config) for more
details about their behaviour.

- `ZEFDB_LOGIN_AUTOCONNECT`
- `ZEFDB_BUTLER_AUTOSTART`
- `ZEFHUB_URL`
