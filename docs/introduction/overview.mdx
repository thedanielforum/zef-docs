_Zef is a foundational layer for end-to-end reactive systems and real-time applications._
--->

#### Zef is an open source, data-oriented toolkit of modules for graph data.

It gives Python developers more power üí™ and flexibility ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è with graph data (among other things). Pick and choose what you need:

- in-memory, immutable database
- fully versioned graphs
- work with your graph data like local data structures
- no separate query language (just use Zef's Python operators!)
- no ORM (low impedance mismatch)
- query and transform data using Python with composable lazy operators
- GraphQL API with low impedance mismatch to data model
- data streams and subscriptions

## What can I use Zef for?

Zef was created for Python developers working with complex data, who want common DB/backend overhead and data infra abstracted away, where real-time, distributed, and time versioning work out-of-the-box.
While Zef is currently in private alpha stage and improving every day, below are some things you can do with Zef!

#### An engineer writing simulation code

- use **ZefOps** as a functional language toolkit to describe transformations and interactions of data (e.g. public transit ridership)
- functional style allows various modeling terms to be "slotted in" or "turned off" with ease

#### Data scientists collaborating on a data set that changes over time

- use **ZefDB** and **ZefHub** to share data, communicated across all workstations simultaneously, in real-time
- built-in time versioning enables consistent analysis of data before or after updates and corrections
- **ZefFunctions** stored on teh graph allow for time versioned records of what filtering/scrubbing techniques were applied

- graph merges enable work on the data in an isolated environment first, before merging results back into the collaborative graph
- subscriptions through **ReactiveZ** provide notifications when new data arrives and can trigger automatic analyses

#### Data analyst producing business analytics

- use **ZefDB** to collate many streams of data into a private graph database
- uses merges and analytics, automatically triggered by **ReactiveZ**, to stream data to company-wide graph database
- use **ZefFX** to quickly deploy an automatic **GraphQL** server to act as a backend for a data exploration website
- on the same graph, create a public facing **GraphQL** server with restricted views on some data
- time versioning ensures all data can be revisited years from now
- graph structure gives flexibility to the data format which may morph over time

#### Backend developer needing a temporary store for user sessions

- use **ZefDB** instead of value lookups in store and uses direct memory access with **ZefQL** instead of constructing SQL or GraphQL queries
- with time versioning, can tell the state of the web app before and after user events, removing the need for careful forethought in designing structure of the data store
- **ReactiveZ** subscriptions provide triggers for user-local or site-wide events
- graph structure gives rise to an easier design without forcing the developer into a tree-like structure of their data

#### (FUTURE) Full stack developer uses **ZefUI** to create a user interface for data entry
- Developer uses a **ZefDB** graph to store server-wide data, with subscriptions providing streams of events for user-facing apps.
- Developer designs a graph with **ZefUI** templates that declare the functionality of the web app, while able to use **ZefQL** to query the in-memory database for fast response times.
- Updates are streamed automatically when data on the graph changes without the need for a custom websocket or GraphQL API. Optimistic updates are possible as a default.
- Developer can deploy the app to a managed **ZefHub** server with a single command.

## Do I have to use all parts of Zef together?

The only requirement at the moment is to use ZefHub (which is free, more details below).
You can choose to use one, some, or all parts of Zef, depending on your use case.

## Why do I have to use Zef with ZefHub?

At our current private alpha stage with users, we feel that using Zef with ZefHub demonstrates the real power and benefits of Zef in its entirety.
We plan on making Zef available for use, independent of ZefHub in the near future.

## Is Zef free?

Yes it's free to use!
Our long-term business model is to offer paid tiers for our ZefHub service, the parameters and pricing which will be determined later.
We will always have a free tier available on ZefHub.

<img alt="zef" src={useBaseUrl("img/zefDB_header.png")} />
An append-only state management tool / library ("database" is such an overloaded
term).

Easily switch between

- client-side (like SQLite),
- on your own server (like PostgreSQL)
- fully hosted (ZefHub)

at any time.

<img alt="zef" src={useBaseUrl("img/zefops_header.png")} />
Zef embraces a data flow oriented design, both pull-based (Iterables & LazyValues)
and push-based (Observables & Awaitables). ZefOps are operators that are the core
building blocks of data pipelines (programs & processes).{" "}

- value semantics
- can be sent over the wire
- highly composable
- contiguous in memory (no serialization required)
- used between different languages (coming soon)

<img alt="zef" src={useBaseUrl("img/reactiveZ_header.png")} />
Build reactive systems based on functional transformations of data streams. ReactiveZ
is heavily inspired by ReactiveX, but we made different choices on some fronts: *
Distributed by design and from the ground up: subscribe to any stream you have access
to, not only the ones in your process. * ZefHub takes care of the coordination of
the data flow between processes * User-friendly cross-language interface for live
data

// # What it is Zef?
// It is a synchronized, time-versioned, cross-language, in-memory, append-only, graph data~~base~~...stream? If this sounds like a bunch of buzz terms mashed together, it is. And frankly, we're not really sure what the concise "one-liner" is right now. ZefDB just takes shit to the next level.

// In contrast to other databases, there is no separate query language. How does that work? Working with zefDB looks like working on local python data structures. Just that the pages of the graph you actually require are loaded in lazily, allowing you to operate on large datasets without noticing so most of the time. zef is an EDSL (embedded domain specific language) for dealing with graph-like information.
