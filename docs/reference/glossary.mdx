### RAE

An acronym that refers to the 3 types which represent information on a Zef graph (RT, AET, ET). Each RAE has an identity which remains stable over time.

### Relation Type (RT)

Defines the edge between any two RAEs on a graph. i.e. RT.Name

### Atomic Entity (AET)

Defines a node with a value type. Values can be assigned over time. i.e. AET.String

### Entity Type (ET)

Defines a node an identifier. Node properties are not contained within the ET and are instead "flattened out" into connected RT(s) and AET(s). i.e. ET.Person

### Abstract RAE

An acronym that refers to the abstract versions of RT, AET, and ET. It represents the concept of a RAE independent of time through all graphs.

### Delegate

The higher level representation of data on a graph. Defines how data (RAEs) is laid out on a graph. Every instance of a RAE is connected to a unique delegate.

### Graph Slice

The state of a graph at a specific point in time.

### Transaction Request (TXRequest)

[Previously GraphDelta] A list that contains the instantiations, terminations, and value assignments a user would like to perform on a graph.

### Transaction (TX)

A list that contains the instantiations, terminations, and value assignments that have been executed on a specific graph. A Transaction is generated after a Transaction Request(s) has been executed.

### UID

An auto-generated, variable length unique identifier given to all graphs and RAEs.

### ZefRef

A struct that holds graph specific information about an Atomic Entity (AET), Entity (ET), or Relation (RT). A ZefRef also holds information about the specific time slice the Entity or Relation exists in.

### EZefRef

Stands for Eternal ZefRef. Similar to a ZefRef but is independent of any time slice reference.

### Tag

A unique user-given, string reference to a specific graph or RAE within a given scope (namespace, organization, etc). Can be used for retrieval.

### Piping '|'

The symbol used to chain operations together (can be seen as the '.' dot notation used in other languages).

### ZefOps

A library of functional, cross-langauge operators which can be used directly in Python code to query and transform data.

### ZefFX

Tools to deal with effects in a controlled and understandable way.

### ZefDB

An in-memory, immutable graph database.

### ReactiveZ

Tools to build reactive systems through functional transformations and subscriptions of data streams.
