### RAE

An acronym that refers to the 3 types which represent information on a Zef graph (RT, AET, ET). Each RAE has an identity which remains stable over time. Properties are not contained within any RAEs and are instead "flattened out" into connected Relations and Attributes.

### Relation (RT)

Defines the edge between any two RAEs on a graph. i.e. RT.Name

### Attribute Entity (AET)

[Previously Atomic Entity] Defines a node with an identity where values can be assigned over time. i.e. AET.String

### Entity (ET)

Defines a node with an identity that defines the objects of a domain. i.e. ET.Person

### Abstract RAE

An acronym that refers to the abstract versions of RT, AET, and ET. It represents the concept of a RAE independent of time through all graphs.

### Delegate

A low level node representing all instances of a specific RAE.

### Graph Slice

The state of a specific graph at a specific point in time.

### Transaction Request (TXRequest)

[Previously GraphDelta] A list that contains the instantiations, terminations, and value assignments a user would like to perform on a graph.

### Transaction (TX)

A set of all instantiations, terminations, and value assignments that have been executed on a specific graph. A Transaction is generated after a Transaction Request(s) has been executed.

### UID

A variable length unique identifier used in various parts of Zef.

### ZefRef

Reference to a RAE or TX seen on a specific graph and at a specific time (graph slice).

### EZefRef

Stands for Eternal ZefRef. Reference to a RAE or TX seen on a specific graph but independent of any time.

### GeneralRef

Reference to a RAE or TX but independent of any graph or time.

### Tag

A unique user-given, string reference to a specific graph or RAE within a given scope (namespace, organization, etc). Can be used for retrieval.

### Piping '|'

The symbol used to chain operations together where data flows from left to right.

### ZefOp

A functional, cross-language operator which can be used directly in Python code to query, traverse, and transform data.

### ZefFX

Tools to deal with effects in a controlled and understandable way.

### ZefDB

An in-memory, immutable graph database.

### ReactiveZ

Tools to build reactive systems through functional transformations and subscriptions of data streams.
