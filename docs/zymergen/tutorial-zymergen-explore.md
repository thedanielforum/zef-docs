title: Exploring a sample Zymergen graph
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The idea of this tutorial is to show some of the structure of the graph used to
describe a Zymergen module and how a schedule is represented on the graph.

It aims to do this by natural exploration and minimizes required prior
knowledge. Images will also be neglected from this tutorial: even though they
would help understand this particular graph, we would like to show how only the
built-in tools of ZefDB should be sufficient to understand a graph structure.
