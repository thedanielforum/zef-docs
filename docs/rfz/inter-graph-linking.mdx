title: RFZ - Inter-Graph Linking
---

Given various use cases we encoutnered with zefUI etc., we want to simplify the interoperatbility of working with ZefRefs between different graphs. 

Let us look at the following scenario, where the RAE `z1` lives in `g1` and `z2` lives in `g2`. We may want to consider being allowing to write

```python
z1 | attach[intergraph[True]][RT.FriendOf, z2]
```
This may look a bit simpler than it is, let's break it down. It says that we want to create an edge to a RAE that lives on *g2*, but we want to do it from a RAE that lives on *g1* and the link should also be instantiated on *g1*.

* If the new creaetd *RT.Friend* relation lives on *g1*, it has to point to something on *g1*. What does it point to? A local RAE of the same lineage as *z2*.
* What if *g2* does not contain such a RAE (of the same lineage as *z2*)? Answ: One is automatically created by merging *z2* into *g1*.
