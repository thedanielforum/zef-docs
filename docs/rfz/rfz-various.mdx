Various small features we want...

### Allow relations to/from BT.ROOT_NODE of a graph

### Allow relations to/from BT.TX_EVENT_NODE

### Transaction Rollback

### Do not create an additional BT.ZEFDB_USER_NODE
We can simply use an ET.ZefDBUser, which is also used by the underlying C++ system. Linking to the outside, merging etc. comes for free.

### graph revisioning system

### Revise value assignment system
Use BT.VALUE_NODE to store actual values and then reference on low level graph. Essential for effective value-based queries. Also allows value sharing.
uid(value_node) = Blake3_hash_truncated(value_type_byte + actual_value)

### Instantiate zefDB user and first tx upon graph instantiation
