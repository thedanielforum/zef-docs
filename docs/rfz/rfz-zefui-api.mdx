title: RFZ - zefUI API
---

One of the core design goals of zefUI is ease of use, also at the cost of being opinionated.

A python user from a python proces terminal / notebook / ... should be able to start zefUI with a single command, if they have a ZefRef to the zef component's or the app's root:
```python
zef_ui(z_my_app)
```
Below the hood, zefDB should check whether a zefUI backend process is already running and whether a browser was launched to display this.
Upon first launch (neither zefUI backend nor a browser are running), it communicates with the tokolosh to start a zefUI backend session on a new port. Subsequently a browser can be launched, pointing this to the new zefUI backened session via url parameters.

The user may also explicitly specify the port to host this on, as well as whether a browser should be launched (both optional function arguments)
`zef_ui(z_my_app, port=3007, launch_browser=False)`.

Upon loading, the front end application is unaware of the zefUI components / apps that will be displayed. This will be sent out as data from the zefUI backend upon connection.

:::note
In contrast to most backend-frontend architectures, zefUI is fully built on the observer pattern. The source of truth for the program state is the most recent time slice of the ui_model graph, a zefDB graph living on the backend. Instead of the front end querying the backend state via a REST / GraphQL API, *everything* is based on subscription from the very foundation. The essence of zefUI is a time-dependent, distributed subscriptions model paired with a compositional model for zefUI components.
