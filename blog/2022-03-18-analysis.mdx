### Danny TODO

- [ ] Get the original Northwind dataset rather than the neo4j export

## 3. Exposing with proxies or adjacency lists

To view the data, we can use native Zef operations and traversal tools. For
example, to get all products and their stock quantity as a dictionary, we could
write:

```py
>>> d = (g | now
           | all[ET.Product]
           | map[lambda z: (z >> RT.ProductName | value | collect,
                            z >> RT.UnitsInStock | value | collect)]
           | func[dict]
           | collect)
       
{'Chai': 39,
 'Chang': 17,
 'Aniseed Syrup': 13,
 "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning": 53,
 ...
```

It's also easy for us to get a subgraph of nodes with an adjacency matrix:

```py
A,nodes,edges = subgraph(g, ET.Employee, RT.ReportsTo)
```

This outputs an adjacency matrix `A`, which has integers that index into the
list `edges` allowing us to recover the original `ZefRef` of each edge. The
rows/cols of `A` correspond also to the list `nodes`. In this output, we haven't
lost any information, although it has become more inconvenient to query.

Algorithms typically expect the adjacency matrix A to contain the edge weights.
Hence, we should transform A before passing it to them. The simplest is just to
convert all edges to have weight 1 with: `A.astype(bool)`.

To make use of networkX algorithms, we can also expose this using the
`ProxyGraph` object of `zef.experimental.networkx`:

```py
>>> pg = ProxyGraph(now(g))
>>> d = {pg.nodes[n]["ProductName"]: pg.nodes[n]["UnitsInStock"]
         for n in pg.nodes if is_a(n.z, ET.Product)}

{'Chai': 39,
 'Chang': 17,
 'Aniseed Syrup': 13,
 "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning": 53,
 ...
```

Note that the proxy graph is not a copy of the data. It is a view on the Zef
graph, translating the networkX request to native Zef commands and then
returning the result in a networkX style.

## 4. Applying algorithms to the data

As a basic example, we can look for connected components of the undirected graph
of all nodes:

```py
>>> import networkx as nx
>>> pg = ProxyGraph(now(g), undirected=True)
>>> 
>>> comps = list(nx.connected_components(pg))
[{Node(#9166),
  Node(#4161),
  Node(#8926),
  ...},
 {Node(#9326)},
 {Node(#9334)}]
```

This is a silly example, as all but two nodes of the dataset are connected.
These two nodes are actually customers who have no orders:

```py
>>> comps | filter[length | equals[1]] | map[only | func[lambda x: x.z]] | collect
[<ZefRef #9326 ET.Customer slice=2>,
 <ZefRef #9334 ET.Customer slice=2>]
```

## Finding communities

I'll leave this for the next blog post!


(PREVIEW)

```py
from sklearn import cluster

#A,A_nodes,A_edges = subgraph(now(g), ET, RT)
pg = ProxyGraph(now(g), undirected=True)

mst = nx.minimum_spanning_tree(pg.to_native())
A = nx.adjacency_matrix(mst)

n_clusters = 5

alg = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, n_init=100)
alg.fit(A)

labels = alg.labels_

label_colors = [
(1,0,0),
(0,1,0),
(0,0,1),
(1,1,0),
(0,1,1)
]
#node_colors = LazyValue(pg.nodes) | map[lambda x: labels[A_nodes.index(x.z)]] | map[lambda x: node_colors[x]] | collect
node_colors = list(labels) | map[lambda x: label_colors[x]] | collect
nx.draw(mst, node_color=node_colors)
```
